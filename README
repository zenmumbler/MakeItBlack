You are some awful creature from a warped dimension who happened to get lost in what seems to be an episode of the old house on the prairie, awful! 

Use your dark bile and turn this place into a wonderful place of darkness if you ever want to get home. 

Full game with in-game explanation and end sequence. There is even a goat. Play time about 10-15 mins.

This was my entry in the Ludum Dare 48 hour game making competition: http://ludumdare.com/compo/
You have to create a game from scratch in 48 hours including code, art assets and sounds. The theme is given at the start of the competition, this time it was: You are the Villain.

The goat reference was a joke that started during the competition, don't worry about it too much.

Look at the things, reuse some of the code (it's not the prettiest thing in the world) and if you do something fun with or because of it, drop me a line via Twitter http://twitter.com/zenmumbler or here on Github.
